### Different CS Projects I Saw

1. A group used a Spotify API to create a Taylor Swift album encyclopedia. You could click on her different albumns and all the song in that albumn would appear, in order. Their fastpages was very easy to navigate and very organized. 

2. A group created a project where the user can input their symptoms and then possible sicknesses the user has will be outputted. I thought this project was such an interesting idea and  is a very useful program for a broad audience.

3. A group created a wordle game. They attempted to make it so you could play the game with English words and with Spanish words. They used an API to pull random 5 letter Spanish words, and made a dictionary themselves with 5-letter English words. I thought it was very cool that they branched out from English, broadening the audience of their program.


### Our Project

We encountered a lot of issues with our API on the day of our presentation. But, in the following week, we were able to implement our API into our project. Next time, I hope to more fully understand the requirements of our preformance task.
