## Reflection
1. Collaboration Quiz: was straightforward
2. Program Design and Development Quiz: Also pretty easy to understand. At times took some extra time to completetly understand the purpose of the code segments.
3. Program Function and Purpose Quiz: Struggle with this one more. Loop code segments were the most difficult for me.
