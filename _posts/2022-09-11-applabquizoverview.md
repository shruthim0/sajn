# Planning out AppLabQuiz

[My Quiz](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/Bqsh3g1uKo4tmvQ-_Ls10hJSpZ7RMBu88Un1jOkY_ho)

-- 

### Quiz Topic
- Quiz on Del Norte 

--- 

### Content

- school colors, mascot, location
- calculate score at the end


---
### Features I Tried Out
**Score Calculation**: I started by defining the variable "score" as 0. After each correct answer, a point is added to the initial score. I later called on this variable at the end when the user clicks on the "Calculate Score" button.           
**Personalization**: The Quiz also starts by asking for the user's name and storing the user's input as a variable. I added this feature with this command:
    - var y = prompt("What is your name?");
Later I called on this variable when presenting the score as "_________'s Score is __/3"

### Features I'm Adding

**Record of Quiz Answers**: I want to store the user's answers in a Dictionary and then make either a for loop or while loop that displays a record of the user's quiz on request.
