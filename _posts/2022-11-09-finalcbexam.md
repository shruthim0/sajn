Incorrect Questions + explanation

Overall Thoughts + Comments: In general I need to pay more attention while reading the question and identifying what the problem is asking me to find. For most of these questions, I solved for the wrong output/variable/etc. because I skimmed over the question instructions. Overall pay more attension while reading the question and make sure you're actually answering the question.

2.
- my answer: It displays true if x is negative and displays false otherwise.
- correct answer: It displays true if x is negative and displays nothing otherwise.
- Explanation: When x is negative, y is assigned the value true and the value of y is displayed. When x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed. It WONT display false, just nothing will be displayed.

15.
- my answer: Users can identify and correct errors they encounter when using released versions of the software.
- correct answer: Users can provide feedback that can be used to incorporate a variety of perspectives into the software.
- Explanation: Users can provide feedback that can help inform program design and development. Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives. I accidentally choose the wrong option.

24.
- my answer: Decimal 5, binary 1011, binary 1101, decimal 12
- correct answer: Decimal 5, binary 1011, decimal 12, binary 1101
- Explanation: Binary 1011 is equivalent to 23+21+20, or decimal 11, and binary 1101 is equivalent to 23+22+20, or decimal 13. The order of the numbers (written in their equivalent decimal format) is 5, 11, 12, 13.

27.
- my answer: A string variable named s and a Boolean variable named a
- correct answer: A string variable named studentName and a Boolean variable named isAbsent
- Explanation: While a string variable and a Boolean variable are appropriate for this situation, the variable names s and a are not meaningful and will make the code segment harder for someone to read.


28.
- my answer: B
- correct answer: C
- Explanation: If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. THE FIRST 25 U ARE STILL CHARGED AS 5 PER U.

42.
- my answer: 18
- correct answer: 16
- Explanation: After initially assigning values to the variables, the code segment assigns the value 4 to num3 and assigns the value 8 to num1. The value of sum at the end of the code segment is 8 + 4 + 4, or 16.


43.
- my answer: 10
- correct answer: 15
- Explanation: 10 would be if it was looped 4 times, not 5.
