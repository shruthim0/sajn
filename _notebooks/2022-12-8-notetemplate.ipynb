    "Procedure:  is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters: are input values of a procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: separating a program's functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality is called\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural Abstraction: which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some other names for procedures?: function\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are procedures effective?: We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program. Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity). Able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc. MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line)\n"

    "- A procedure call interrupts a series of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. After executing, it will return to the original call and finish the statements.\n",
    "- in python, to call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure (there may not be parameters, but parenthesis must be there).\n",
    "- procedural abstraction: process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it.\n",
    "    - Have variable parameters\n",
    "    - Code handles different situations depending on how its parameters are set/called\n",

The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate \"APCSP\" into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. "
