            "content": "Take some additional notes that you would like here for 3.12 and 3.13. We will be looking for additional notes from the presentation. . What are procedures? . Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values . Parameters: are input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality is called . Procedural Abstraction: which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: function . Why are procedures effective?: We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program. Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity). Able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc. MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line) . Extra Notes . A procedure call interrupts a series of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. After executing, it will return to the original call and finish the statements. | in python, to call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure (there may not be parameters, but parenthesis must be there). | procedural abstraction: process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it. Have variable parameters | Code handles different situations depending on how its parameters are set/called | It allows a solution to a large problem based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. | Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality is called modularity | . | . function subtraction(a,b) { return a - b; } subtraction(10,12) . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . def dectobinary(decimal): binary = 0 i = 0 num = decimal while(num &gt; 0): binary = ((num%2)*(10**i)) + binary # set binary equal to remainder of the input/2, multiplied by 10^i num = int(num/2) #now number equal num/2 rounded to an integer i += 1 #incriment by 1 print(&quot;Your number &quot; + str(decimal) + &quot; in binary is &quot; + str(binary)) #output result decimal = 7 dectobinary(decimal) . Your number 7 in binary is 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . a = int(input(&quot;Enter your first value&quot;)) b= int(input(&quot;Enter your second value?&quot;)) def function(a,b): if a &gt; b: print(str(a) + &quot; (a) is the larger value!&quot;) print(str(b) + &quot; (b) is the smaller value!&quot;) else: if b &gt; a: print(str(b) + &quot; (b) is the larger value&quot;) print(str(a) + &quot; (a) is the smaller value!&quot;) if b == a: print(str(a) + str(b) + &quot; (a and b) are equal&quot;) function(a,b) . 4 (b) is the larger value 1 (a) is the smaller value! . a = int(input(&quot;Enter your first value&quot;)) b= int(input(&quot;Enter your second value?&quot;)) def findMax(a,b): if a &gt; b: print(str(a) + &quot; (a) is the larger value!&quot;) else : if b &gt; a: print(str(b) + &quot; (b) is the larger value!&quot;) def findMin(a,b): if a &lt; b: print(str(a) + &quot; (a) is the smaller value!&quot;) else: if b &lt; a: print(str(b) + &quot; (b) is the smaller value!&quot;) findMax(a,b) findMin(a,b) . 4 (b) is the larger value! 1 (a) is the smaller value! . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . import math def charToBinary(term): char = [] binary = [] for x in term: char.append(ord(x)) #each character from APCSP is assigned to a list (char) for x in char: binary.append(int(bin(x)[2:])) #for each character in list char, the binary of that character is appended to binary list (I just used the built in bin conversion function) return binary #binary list is printed print(&quot; &#39;APCSP&#39; in binary is: &quot;) print(charToBinary(&quot;APCSP&quot;)) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get . &#39;APCSP&#39; in binary is: [1000001, 1010000, 1000011, 1010011, 1010000] .",

            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the next power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the next, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? .

Conditionals vs Booleans . Conditionals and booleans can be equivalent. . For example, let&#39;s say there are two booleans: rainy and sunny. . Let&#39;s look at the following code: . sunny = true; rainy = false; . if (sunny) { umbrella = false; } else if (rainy) { umbrella = true; } else { umbrella = false; } console.log(umbrella); . false . The code above is the same as below: . umbrella = !sunny &amp;&amp; rainy; console.log(umbrella); . false . To determine if two conditionals and booleans are the same, you can substitute the four possibilities that the two booleans (sunny and rainy) can be (listed below) into the conditional and boolean and see if both cases match: . sunny = true, rainy = true . sunny = true, rainy = false . sunny = false, rainy = true . sunny = false, rainy = false . Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 . Convert the result back to decimal: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 -&gt; 192.168.0.0 | The network address is 192.168.0.0 . function iptobinary(ip, subnet) { var ip = prompt(&quot;Enter your IP adress:&quot;); var subnet = prompt(&quot;Enter your subnet mask:&quot;); } .",

To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. Defines two variables, num and num2.

Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 counter = 1 for i in range (0, 10): if i % 2 != 1: sum = sum + i counter = counter + 2 print(sum) . 20 . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The Collatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 . x = int(input(&quot;Enter any integer!&quot;)) while x != 1: if x % 2 == 0: x = int(x / 2) else: x = (x*3) + 1 print(x) . 12 6 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 .",

Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = Quiz[i] print (record) i += 1 return while_loop() .
